// Packages: A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
// Crates: A tree of modules that produces a library or executable
// Modules and use: Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths
// Paths: A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module


// any code written even its a source file is a crate 
// crates are of two types binary crates and library crates 
// crates that have a main function are binary crates every code we wrote before is a 
// binary crate
// while library crates dont have a main function 
// cargo.toml file tells how to build the crate
// cargo is a package that contains bundle of crates
// BUT A package can have only one library crate
